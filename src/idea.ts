/*

considerations
- collaborative editing and version control
- type checking at runtime or typescript
  - sourcemap errors
- blocks can functions or data structures
  - functions and data structures are the same thing because functions construct data structures.
- no constraint solving for now, just one-way data flow

examples
- CSG editor
- Synthethizer
- Application Storyboard
- Contacts Application / Brain Web?!!

todo
- build a graph editor

  - connect lines between blocks
  - group blocks to create recursive drawings
  - dragging autoscroll
  - view grid
  - view origin
  - view zoom and offset stats
  - zoom to fit
  - zoom / scroll boundaries
  - tab through selection
  - block layer height
  - new block goes in the middle
  - hold cmd to snap to grid

- persist everything immutably
- make it do some simple math
