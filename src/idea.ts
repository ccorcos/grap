/*

considerations
- collaborative editing and version control
- type checking at runtime or typescript
  - sourcemap errors
- blocks can functions or data structures
  - functions and data structures are the same thing because functions construct data structures.
- no constraint solving for now, just one-way data flow

examples
- CSG editor
- Synthethizer
- Application Storyboard
- Contacts Application / Brain Web?!!

todo
- build a graph editor
  - select blocks, delete blocks
  - zoom and move around the surface
  - connect lines between blocks
- persist everything immutably
- make it do some simple math
