/*

considerations
- collaborative editing and version control
- type checking at runtime or typescript
  - sourcemap errors
- blocks can functions or data structures
  - functions and data structures are the same thing because functions construct data structures.
- no constraint solving for now, just one-way data flow

examples
- CSG editor
- Synthethizer
- Application Storyboard
- Contacts Application / Brain Web?!!

todo
- build a graph editor
  - better ux
    - right-click to delete as well
      - quick prompt actions
    - block dragging autoscroll
  - connect lines between blocks
  - group blocks to create recursive drawings
  - copy paste blocks

- persist everything immutably
- make it do some simple math


- later
  - hold cmd to snap to grid
  - control block layer height
  - zoom to fit
  - zoom / scroll boundaries
